# Real-Time Adaptive Signal Processing Algorithm Evolution

This example demonstrates how to use OpenEvolve to automatically discover and optimize real-time signal processing algorithms for non-stationary time series data. The challenge involves developing algorithms that can filter volatile signals while preserving important dynamics and minimizing computational latency.

## Problem Overview

### The Challenge
We need to develop a real-time signal processing algorithm that can:

1. **Filter noise** from volatile, non-stationary time series data
2. **Preserve genuine signal dynamics** and trend changes
3. **Minimize spurious directional reversals** caused by noise
4. **Achieve near-zero phase delay** for real-time applications
5. **Operate efficiently** within computational constraints

### Input Signal Characteristics
- **Type**: Univariate time series (1D array of real-valued samples)
- **Properties**:
  - Non-linear dynamics
  - Non-stationary statistical properties  
  - Aperiodic (non-seasonal) behavior
  - High frequency variability and volatility
  - Rapidly changing spectral characteristics

### Technical Constraints
- **Causal Processing**: Must use finite-length sliding window
- **Fixed Latency**: Output length = Input length - Window size
- **Real-time Capability**: Process samples as they arrive
- **Memory Efficiency**: Bounded memory usage

## Multi-Objective Optimization Framework

The algorithm performance is evaluated using a composite metric based on the research specification:

### Optimization Function
```
J(Œ∏) = Œ±‚ÇÅ¬∑S(Œ∏) + Œ±‚ÇÇ¬∑L_recent(Œ∏) + Œ±‚ÇÉ¬∑L_avg(Œ∏) + Œ±‚ÇÑ¬∑R(Œ∏)
```

Where:
- **S(Œ∏)**: **Slope Change Penalty** - Counts directional reversals in the filtered signal
- **L_recent(Œ∏)**: **Instantaneous Lag Error** - |y[n] - x[n]| at the most recent sample
- **L_avg(Œ∏)**: **Average Tracking Error** - Mean absolute error over the processing window
- **R(Œ∏)**: **False Reversal Penalty** - Trend changes that don't match the clean signal
- **Weighting coefficients**: Œ±‚ÇÅ=0.3, Œ±‚ÇÇ=Œ±‚ÇÉ=0.2, Œ±‚ÇÑ=0.3

### Additional Evaluation Metrics
- **Signal Fidelity**: Correlation with ground truth clean signal
- **Noise Reduction**: Improvement in signal-to-noise ratio
- **Computational Efficiency**: Processing time per sample
- **Robustness**: Consistent performance across diverse signal types

## Proposed Algorithmic Approaches

The initial implementation provides a foundation that evolution can improve upon:

### 1. Baseline Implementation
- Simple moving average filter
- Weighted exponential moving average

### 2. Potential Advanced Techniques (for evolution to discover)
- **Adaptive Filtering**: Kalman filters, particle filters, adaptive weights
- **Multi-Scale Processing**: Wavelet decomposition, empirical mode decomposition
- **Predictive Enhancement**: Local polynomial fitting, neural network prediction
- **Trend Detection**: Change point detection, momentum indicators
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Ensemble methods combining multiple techniques

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
1. Install OpenEvolve and its dependencies
2. Install example-specific requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up your LLM API key (e.g., `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable)

### Testing the Setup (Recommended)
First, validate that everything is working correctly:
```bash
cd examples/signal_processing
python test_setup.py
```

This will test the initial implementation and evaluator to ensure everything is ready for evolution.

### Running the Evolution
From the OpenEvolve root directory:
```bash
python openevolve-run.py examples/signal_processing/config.yaml
```

Or from the signal_processing directory:
```bash
python ../../openevolve-run.py config.yaml
```

### Monitoring Progress
The evolution will create an `openevolve_output` directory containing:
- **Checkpoints**: Saved population states at regular intervals
- **Logs**: Detailed evolution progress and metrics
- **Best Programs**: Top-performing algorithm implementations

## Understanding the Results

### Key Metrics to Watch
1. **Overall Score**: Primary selection metric (higher is better)
2. **Composite Score**: The main J(Œ∏) optimization function
3. **Correlation**: How well the filtered signal matches the clean ground truth
4. **Noise Reduction**: Improvement in signal quality
5. **Slope Changes**: Number of directional reversals (lower is better)
6. **Success Rate**: Fraction of test signals processed successfully

### Actual Evolution Patterns (Observed)
- **Early iterations (1-10)**: Discovered Savitzky-Golay filtering with adaptive polynomial order
- **Mid evolution (10-100)**: Parameter optimization and performance stabilization around 0.37 score

## Test Signal Characteristics

The evaluator uses 5 different synthetic test signals to ensure robustness:

1. **Smooth Sinusoidal**: Basic sinusoid with linear trend
2. **Multi-Frequency**: Multiple frequency components combined
3. **Non-Stationary**: Frequency-modulated signal
4. **Step Changes**: Sudden level changes to test responsiveness
5. **Random Walk**: Stochastic process with trend

Each signal has different noise levels and lengths to test algorithm adaptability.

## Initial Algorithm Analysis

The starting point includes:
- **Basic moving average**: Simple but may over-smooth
