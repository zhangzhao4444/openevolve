First, let's improve the initial sampling strategy to better cover the search space:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        # Hybrid initialization - combine random and low-discrepancy sampling\n        if restart == 0:\n            # Start with center point\n            x, y = (bounds[0]+bounds[1])/2, (bounds[0]+bounds[1])/2\n        else:\n            # Use Halton sequence for better space coverage\n            def halton(index, base):\n                result = 0\n                f = 1.0 / base\n                i = index\n                while i > 0:\n                    result += f * (i % base)\n                    i = i // base\n                    f = f / base\n                return result\n            x = bounds[0] + (bounds[1]-bounds[0]) * halton(restart, 2)\n            y = bounds[0] + (bounds[1]-bounds[0]) * halton(restart, 3)\n=======\n        # Improved initialization with better space coverage\n        if restart == 0:\n            # Center point\n            x, y = (bounds[0]+bounds[1])/2, (bounds[0]+bounds[1])/2\n        elif restart == 1:\n            # Corners\n            x, y = bounds[0], bounds[0]\n        elif restart == 2:\n            x, y = bounds[0], bounds[1]\n        elif restart == 3:\n            x, y = bounds[1], bounds[0]\n        elif restart == 4:\n            x, y = bounds[1], bounds[1]\n        else:\n            # Sobol sequence for better uniformity\n            def sobol(index, dim):\n                # Simple implementation of Sobol sequence\n                v = 1 << 31\n                while index & 1:\n                    index >>= 1\n                    v ^= v >> (dim + 1)\n                return (index + 0.5) * (1.0 / (1 << 31))\n            x = bounds[0] + (bounds[1]-bounds[0]) * sobol(restart, 0)\n            y = bounds[0] + (bounds[1]-bounds[0]) * sobol(restart, 1)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n2. Let's improve the cooling schedule and step size adaptation:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            # More sophisticated cooling schedule with slower initial cooling\n            temp = max(0.01, np.exp(-5 * progress))  # Exponential cooling\n            # Adaptive step size based on current temperature and progress\n            step_size = (0.5 + 0.5 * np.cos(np.pi * progress)) * temp * (bounds[1]-bounds[0])\n=======\n            # Improved cooling schedule with plateau phase\n            if progress < 0.2:\n                temp = 1.0  # Initial exploration phase\n            elif progress < 0.8:\n                temp = max(0.1, 1.0 - (progress-0.2)/0.6)  # Gradual cooling\n            else:\n                temp = max(0.01, 0.1 * np.exp(-10*(progress-0.8)))  # Final convergence\n            \n            # Adaptive step size with momentum awareness\n            step_size = (0.3 + 0.7 * (1 - progress)**2) * temp * (bounds[1]-bounds[0])\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n3. Finally, let's enhance the refinement phase:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Enhanced final refinement with momentum and adaptive learning\n    step = 0.1\n    momentum_x, momentum_y = 0, 0\n    for _ in range(200):  # More refinement iterations\n=======\n    # Improved final refinement with conjugate gradient-like behavior\n    step = 0.1\n    momentum_x, momentum_y = 0, 0\n    prev_dx, prev_dy = 0, 0\n    for refine_iter in range(300):  # Increased refinement iterations\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes:\n1. Replace Halton sequence with a more strategic initial sampling (corners + Sobol sequence) for better space coverage\n2. Improve the cooling schedule to have distinct exploration and exploitation phases\n3. Enhance the refinement phase with more iterations and conjugate gradient-like behavior\n4. Adjust step size adaptation to be more aggressive early on while maintaining stability\n\nThe changes should improve both value_score (better chance of finding global minimum) and distance_score (more precise final location) while maintaining the algorithm's reliability. The modified cooling schedule and initialization strategy should help escape local minima more effectively.\n\nThe refinement phase improvements will help converge more precisely to the actual minimum once in its vicinity. The increased number of refinement iterations is justified by the metrics showing we need better precision in the final result."],"system":"You are an expert programmer specializing in optimization algorithms.

The multi-start implementation can be improved by better distributing iterations:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Multi-start with proper iteration distribution\n    best_results = []\n    iterations_per_start = iterations // num_starts\n=======\n    # Multi-start with adaptive iteration allocation\n    best_results = []\n    remaining_iterations = iterations\n    for start in range(num_starts):\n        # Allocate more iterations to promising starts\n        iterations_per_start = remaining_iterations // (num_starts - start)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n4.

Improve exploration with higher initial temperature and occasional large steps\n2. Better balance exploration/exploitation with adaptive step sizes\n3. Allocate iterations more efficiently across restarts\n4. Maintain better diversity in the search with improved acceptance criteria\n\nThe modifications should particularly help with value_score and distance_score by reducing the chance of getting stuck in local minima while still efficiently converging to the global minimum. The cooling rate change and occasional large steps help escape local basins, while the improved acceptance criteria maintains some exploration even in later stages.\n\nThe multi-start improvement ensures we don't waste iterations on unpromising regions while still giving enough time to properly explore each starting point. This should lead to more reliable discovery of the global minimum."],"system":"You are an expert programmer specializing in optimization algorithms.

Improve the step size adaptation for better local search:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            step_size = (bounds[1] - bounds[0]) * (0.1 + 0.9 * (1 - i/iterations_per_start))\n=======\n            # More adaptive step size with occasional large jumps\n            if np.random.random() < 0.1:  # 10% chance for big jump\n                step_size = (bounds[1] - bounds[0]) * 0.5\n            else:\n                # Gradually refine search while maintaining some exploration\n                step_size = (bounds[1] - bounds[0]) * (0.05 + 0.25 * (1 - i/iterations_per_start)**3)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes will:\n1. Fix the iteration allocation logic that was broken in the original code\n2. Improve the temperature schedule with exponential decay and add dynamic exploration probability\n3. Make step sizes more adaptive with occasional large jumps to escape local minima\n4. Maintain the reliability while improving exploration capabilities\n\nThe changes are inspired by the top-performing programs in the history while addressing the specific metric regressions. The exponential temperature decay and dynamic exploration probability should particularly help with the value_score and distance_score metrics by better balancing exploration and exploitation.\n\nThe occasional large jumps (10% probability) combined with the gradually reducing step size should help escape local minima while still allowing for precise local search near promising areas. The improved temperature schedule helps maintain better exploration in early iterations while still converging effectively."],"system":"You are an expert programmer specializing in optimization algorithms.

The key issues are the regression in value_score and distance_score, indicating we need better exploration/exploitation balance.\n\n1. First, let's improve the initial temperature and cooling schedule:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    initial_temp = 200.0  # Higher initial temperature for wider exploration\n    cooling_rate = 0.985  # Slower cooling for better local search\n    min_temp = 0.01  # Minimum temperature threshold\n=======\n    initial_temp = 500.0  # Even higher initial temperature for better global exploration\n    cooling_rate = 0.995  # Much slower cooling to maintain exploration longer\n    min_temp = 0.001  # Lower minimum temperature for finer final search\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n2. Let's enhance the step size adaptation to be more dynamic:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        step_size = (bounds[1] - bounds[0]) * (0.1 + 0.9*temp_ratio) * progress_ratio\n=======\n        # More aggressive early exploration, finer later search\n        step_size = (bounds[1] - bounds[0]) * (0.05 + 0.95*temp_ratio**0.5) * progress_ratio**1.5\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n3. Improve the multi-start strategy by focusing more on promising regions:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    coarse_starts = num_starts * 3  # More initial samples\n    coarse_iter = max(50, iterations // 10)  # Fixed minimum coarse iterations\n=======\n    coarse_starts = num_starts * 5  # Even more initial samples for better coverage\n    coarse_iter = max(100, iterations // 5)  # More thorough initial search\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n4. Enhance the acceptance probability calculation:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            adaptive_temp = temp * (1 + np.log1p(i)/np.log1p(iterations))  # Slower temp decay\n=======\n            # More sophisticated adaptive temperature considering both iteration and progress\n            adaptive_temp = temp * (1 + 2*np.log1p(i)/np.log1p(iterations) - (current_value-best_value)/abs(best_value+1e-9))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes will:\n1. Increase initial exploration capability with higher temperature\n2. Maintain exploration longer with slower cooling\n3. Make step sizes more dynamic and situation-aware\n4. Improve the initial coarse search coverage\n5. Make the acceptance criteria more intelligent by considering both iteration progress and solution quality\n\nThe modifications should help escape local minima more effectively while still converging to the global minimum, addressing the regressions in value_score and distance_score. The slower cooling and more thorough initial search will particularly help with the standard_deviation_score by making results more consistent.\n\nThe changes maintain the algorithm's reliability while improving its ability to find better solutions more consistently, as evidenced by the top-performing programs in the history that used similar approaches with random restarts and careful temperature management."],"system":"You are an expert programmer specializing in optimization algorithms.

Properly distributes iterations across restarts\n2. Uses quadratic temperature cooling for better exploration\n3. Maintains larger step sizes longer (minimum 10% of search space)\n4. Uses normal distribution for more focused local search\n5. Scales initial temperature with search space size\n6. Simplified and more efficient code structure\n7. Better random restart implementation\n\nThese changes should significantly improve the algorithm's ability to:\n- Escape local minima through better temperature management\n- Explore the search space more thoroughly\n- Make more intelligent local moves\n- Better utilize the total computation budget\n\nThe improvements are inspired by the top-performing programs in the history while maintaining the core simulated annealing approach."],"system":"You are an expert programmer specializing in optimization algorithms.

Finally, let's add a small improvement to the restart mechanism to ensure better coverage:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    for _ in range(num_restarts):\n        # Initialize with random point\n        current_x = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        current_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n=======\n    for restart in range(num_restarts):\n        # Initialize with quasi-random points for better coverage\n        if restart == 0:\n            # First point at center to cover middle region\n            current_x, current_y = 0, 0\n        else:\n            # Subsequent points use Halton sequence for better space coverage\n            current_x = bounds[0] + (bounds[1]-bounds[0]) * (0.5 + 0.5 * np.cos(restart * 2.39996))\n            current_y = bounds[0] + (bounds[1]-bounds[0]) * (0.5 + 0.5 * np.sin(restart * 2.39996))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes improve the algorithm in several ways:\n1. Better temperature management allows for more thorough exploration early on while still converging\n2. Improved step size adaptation balances exploration and exploitation\n3. Adaptive cooling helps maintain search momentum when finding improvements\n4. Better restart initialization provides more systematic coverage of the search space\n\nThe changes are inspired by the top-performing programs which showed excellent results with simulated annealing approaches, while adding some additional refinements based on modern optimization techniques.\n\nThe higher initial temperature and slower cooling rate should help escape local minima more effectively, while the improved step size adaptation and restart initialization should help find better solutions more consistently."],"system":"You are an expert programmer specializing in optimization algorithms.

Trigger escape jumps more frequently and with better conditions\n4. Maintain a stronger bias toward the best solution while still allowing exploration\n\nThe changes should improve the algorithm's ability to:\n- Explore the search space more thoroughly early on\n- Make more intelligent moves between local minima\n- Maintain better stability in the final convergence phase\n- Better balance between exploration and exploitation\n\nThe metrics that should particularly improve are:\n- value_score (better chance of finding global minimum)\n- distance_score (more accurate final position)\n- standard_deviation_score (more consistent results)\n\nThe changes maintain the core algorithm structure while making key parameters more adaptive and effective."],"system":"You are an expert programmer specializing in optimization algorithms.

Enhance the restart strategy to focus more on promising regions:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    for _ in range(num_restarts):\n        # Initialize with random point and temperature\n        current_x = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        current_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n=======\n    for restart in range(num_restarts):\n        # Initialize with random point but bias towards better regions after first restart\n        if restart == 0 or global_best_value == float('inf'):\n            current_x = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n            current_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        else:\n            # Perturb the best found solution with decreasing magnitude\n            perturbation = (bounds[1] - bounds[0]) * 0.5 / (restart + 1)\n            current_x = np.clip(global_best_x + np.random.normal(0, perturbation), bounds[0], bounds[1])\n            current_y = np.clip(global_best_y + np.random.normal(0, perturbation), bounds[0], bounds[1])\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes improve the algorithm by:\n1.

Implementing a more sophisticated step size adaptation that balances exploration and exploitation\n3. Making restarts more intelligent by focusing subsequent searches around promising regions while still maintaining diversity\n\nThe improved temperature scheduling helps escape local minima more effectively, while the enhanced step size adaptation provides better local search capabilities. The restart strategy now builds on previous good solutions while still maintaining the ability to explore new regions.\n\nThese changes should significantly improve the value_score and distance_score metrics by helping the algorithm find better minima while maintaining the reliability shown in the runs_successfully metric."],"system":"You are an expert programmer specializing in optimization algorithms.

Add a diversification mechanism when we get stuck:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            # Cool down\n            temp *= cooling_rate\n=======\n            # Cool down and occasionally jump to new area\n            temp *= cooling_rate\n            if i % 100 == 0 and temp < 0.1:  # Periodically check if stuck\n                current_x = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n                current_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n                current_value = evaluate_function(current_x, current_y)\n                temp = max(1.0, abs(current_value) * 0.5)  # Reset temperature\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes will:\n1. Make the initial temperature adaptive to the starting point's value, helping escape deeper local minima\n2. Introduce a more dynamic step size that oscillates to avoid getting stuck\n3. Add periodic diversification when the algorithm appears stuck (low temperature)\n4. Maintain the reliability of the algorithm while improving its exploration capabilities\n\nThe changes are inspired by the top-performing programs in the history while introducing new elements to better handle the complex function landscape. The slower cooling rate and adaptive temperature should help maintain exploration longer, while the dynamic step size and periodic jumps help escape local minima.\n\nThe metrics should improve because:\n- value_score should increase as we're more likely to find better minima\n- distance_score should improve as we explore more of the search space\n- overall_score should benefit from both improvements\n- reliability is maintained through the restart mechanism"],"system":"You are an expert programmer specializing in optimization algorithms.

The key areas for improvement are value_score and distance_score, which suggest we need better exploration of the search space.\n\n1. First, let's improve the initial point selection strategy to better cover the search space:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            # Subsequent points use Halton sequence for better space coverage\n            current_x = bounds[0] + (bounds[1]-bounds[0]) * (0.5 + 0.5 * np.cos(restart * 2.39996))\n            current_y = bounds[0] + (bounds[1]-bounds[0]) * (0.5 + 0.5 * np.sin(restart * 2.39996))\n=======\n            # Use Sobol sequence for better low-discrepancy sampling\n            phi = restart * np.pi * (3 - np.sqrt(5))  # Golden angle spacing\n            current_x = bounds[0] + (bounds[1]-bounds[0]) * (0.5 + 0.5 * np.cos(phi))\n            current_y = bounds[0] + (bounds[1]-bounds[0]) * (0.5 + 0.5 * np.sin(phi))\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n2. Let's improve the adaptive step size calculation to be more dynamic:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            progress = i / iterations\n            step = (bounds[1] - bounds[0]) * (0.2 * (1 - progress) + 0.01 * progress)\n=======\n            progress = i / iterations\n            # More aggressive initial exploration, finer tuning later\n            step = (bounds[1] - bounds[0]) * (0.3 * np.exp(-4 * progress) + 0.01)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n3. Enhance the temperature cooling schedule:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        temp = 10.0  # Higher initial temperature to better explore\n        cooling_rate = 0.995  # Slower cooling\n        min_temp = 0.01  # Minimum temperature threshold\n=======\n        temp = 20.0  # Even higher initial temperature for better exploration\n        cooling_rate = 0.99  # Slightly faster cooling but with better adaptation\n        min_temp = 0.001  # Lower minimum temperature for finer convergence\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n4.

Use a more uniform space-filling sequence (golden angle spacing) for initial points\n2. Make the step size more dynamic with exponential decay for better exploration/exploitation balance\n3. Allow for more aggressive exploration early on with higher initial temperature\n4. Make the acceptance probability more adaptive to the search progress\n\nThe modifications maintain the algorithm's reliability while improving its ability to escape local minima and find the global minimum more consistently, which should improve the value_score and distance_score metrics.\n\nThe cooling rate change combined with the enhanced acceptance probability will help balance exploration and exploitation more effectively throughout the search process. The lower minimum temperature allows for finer convergence when we're close to the minimum."],"system":"You are an expert programmer specializing in optimization algorithms.

Increase initial temperature for better early exploration\n2. Make the cooling rate slightly faster but more adaptive\n3. Improve step size adaptation with better exploration/exploitation balance\n4. Make perturbations more frequent and adaptive to both temperature and search progress\n5. Add dynamic thresholds for perturbation decisions\n\nThe changes maintain the core simulated annealing approach while making it more robust against getting stuck in local minima. The higher initial temperature and more aggressive early exploration should help find better regions of the search space, while the dynamic step sizes and perturbation strategy should help escape local minima more effectively.\n\nThe modifications are based on the top-performing programs in the history which showed excellent value_score and distance_score metrics, particularly those that used more aggressive exploration strategies early in the search."],"system":"You are an expert programmer specializing in optimization algorithms.

Improve the balance between exploration and exploitation\n\nThe changes are designed to improve the algorithm's ability to escape local minima while still converging to the global minimum, which should directly improve the value_score and distance_score metrics. The slower cooling rate and higher initial temperature will help with exploration, while the improved step size and restart conditions will help maintain diversity in the search.\n\nThe modifications maintain the core simulated annealing approach while making it more robust against getting stuck in local minima, which was identified as the main issue from the performance metrics."],"system":"You are an expert programmer specializing in optimization algorithms.

Improve the acceptance probability calculation:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            # Improved acceptance probability with dynamic threshold\n            delta = value - current_value\n            adaptive_temp = temp * (1 + np.log1p(i)/np.log1p(iterations))  # Slower temp decay\n            if delta < 0 or (temp > min_temp and np.random.random() < np.exp(-delta/adaptive_temp)):\n=======\n            # Enhanced acceptance probability with adaptive threshold\n            delta = value - current_value\n            # Non-linear temperature adaptation based on progress\n            progress = i / iterations_per_start\n            adaptive_temp = temp * (1 + 2*(1-progress)**3)  # More aggressive early exploration\n            if delta < 0 or (temp > min_temp and \n                           np.random.random() < np.exp(-delta/(adaptive_temp + 1e-8))):\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes will:\n1. Use Latin Hypercube sampling for better initial space coverage (improves exploration)\n2. Adjust temperature parameters for better global search\n3. Enhance the acceptance probability calculation to be more adaptive\n4. Increase the number of coarse starts for better initial sampling\n5. Make the temperature decay more aggressive early on while maintaining fine search capability\n\nThe modifications maintain the core simulated annealing approach while improving its ability to escape local minima through:\n- Better initial sampling\n- More aggressive early exploration\n- Smoother transition between exploration and exploitation\n- More thorough coverage of the search space\n\nThis should improve the value_score and distance_score metrics by finding better minima more consistently."],"system":"You are an expert programmer specializing in optimization algorithms.

The main problems are:\n1. The `temp` variable is used before assignment in the first loop\n2. The algorithm structure is confusing with duplicate search logic\n3.

First, fix the temperature initialization issue and simplify the structure:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Initialize with a random point\n    current_x = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n    current_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n    current_value = evaluate_function(current_x, current_y)\n    \n    best_x, best_y, best_value = current_x, current_y, current_value\n    \n    # Improved simulated annealing parameters\n    initial_temp = 20.0  # Higher initial temperature to explore more\n    cooling_rate = 0.99  # Slower cooling for better exploration\n    \n    for i in range(iterations):\n        # Adaptive step size based on temperature\n        step_size = (bounds[1] - bounds[0]) * (temp/initial_temp)\n        # Generate neighbor point (smaller step size as we progress)\n        step_size = (bounds[1] - bounds[0]) * (1 - i/iterations)\n=======\n    # Improved simulated annealing parameters\n    initial_temp = 10.0  # Balanced initial temperature\n    cooling_rate = 0.95  # Faster cooling but with restarts\n    \n    # Improved multi-start with better iteration allocation\n    best_results = []\n    iterations_per_start = iterations // num_starts\n    \n    for _ in range(num_starts):\n        # Initialize with random point\n        current_x = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        current_y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        current_value = evaluate_function(current_x, current_y)\n        best_x, best_y, best_value = current_x, current_y, current_value\n        temp = initial_temp\n        \n        for i in range(iterations_per_start):\n            # Generate neighbor with adaptive step size\n            step_size = (bounds[1] - bounds[0]) * (temp/initial_temp)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n2.

Remove the redundant first search loop entirely (the one before the multi-start section) since we're now doing all searches in the multi-start loop.\n\nThese changes will:\n1. Fix the variable reference error by properly initializing temperature\n2. Make the algorithm more reliable by focusing on the multi-start approach\n3. Improve exploration with better temperature and step size control\n4. Add numerical stability to the acceptance probability calculation\n5. Remove duplicate code paths that were causing confusion\n\nThe improved version maintains the benefits of simulated annealing (ability to escape local minima) while being more robust and easier to understand. The cooling rate is slightly faster (0.95 vs 0.99) but with multiple restarts, this provides a better balance between exploration and exploitation.\n\nWould you like me to suggest any additional improvements to specific parts of the algorithm?"],"system":"You are an expert programmer specializing in optimization algorithms.

The key issues are in value_score and distance_score, indicating we need better global exploration.\n\n1. First, let's improve the initial temperature calculation to better match the function's landscape:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        initial_value = evaluate_function(current_x, current_y)\n        temp = max(5.0, 2 * abs(initial_value))  # Even higher initial temperature\n=======\n        initial_value = evaluate_function(current_x, current_y)\n        temp = max(10.0, 3 * abs(initial_value))  # Higher initial temperature for better exploration\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n2. Let's modify the cooling rate to be more adaptive based on progress:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        cooling_rate = 0.995  # Extremely slow cooling for better exploration\n=======\n        cooling_rate = 0.99  # Slightly faster cooling but with adaptive adjustments\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n3. Improve the perturbation strategy when stuck in local minima:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            if i % 30 == 0 and (current_value - best_value) > 0.05 * abs(best_value):\n                # Adaptive perturbation based on temperature\n                perturbation_scale = min(0.7, 0.3 + temp/10) * (bounds[1]-bounds[0])\n=======\n            if i % 20 == 0 and (current_value - best_value) > 0.03 * abs(best_value):\n                # More aggressive perturbation when stuck\n                perturbation_scale = min(1.0, 0.5 + temp/5) * (bounds[1]-bounds[0])\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n4. Enhance the step size calculation for better exploration-exploitation balance:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            base_step = (bounds[1] - bounds[0]) * 0.3  # Larger initial steps\n            progress = i / iterations\n            # More aggressive exploration early, finer tuning later\n            step = base_step * (temp + 0.1) * (1 - 0.95*progress)**2 * (0.3 + 0.7*np.random.random())\n=======\n            base_step = (bounds[1] - bounds[0]) * 0.4  # Even larger initial steps\n            progress = i / iterations\n            # Dynamic step size with temperature and progress awareness\n            step = base_step * (temp + 0.1) * (1 - 0.9*progress)**3 * (0.2 + 0.8*np.random.random())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes will:\n1. Start with higher temperatures to better escape initial local minima\n2. Use a slightly faster but more adaptive cooling schedule\n3. Trigger perturbations more frequently and with larger jumps when stuck\n4. Use more dynamic step sizes that maintain exploration longer\n\nThe modifications maintain the algorithm's reliability while improving its ability to find the global minimum by:\n- Increasing initial exploration capability\n- Making local escape mechanisms more aggressive\n- Better balancing exploration and exploitation phases\n- Maintaining the random restart strategy that worked well in previous versions\n\nThe changes are based on the top-performing programs in the history which showed excellent value_score and distance_score metrics, particularly their use of more aggressive exploration parameters early in the search."],"system":"You are an expert programmer specializing in optimization algorithms.

The changes should improve the distance_score and standard_deviation_score by finding better minima more consistently.\n\nThe higher initial temperature and slower cooling rate will help with exploration in the early stages, while the improved step size adaptation and restart strategy will help maintain diversity in the search. The directed restarts towards promising areas should help refine the search in good regions while still allowing for exploration."],"system":"You are an expert programmer specializing in optimization algorithms.

Let's improve the acceptance probability calculation:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n            prob = np.exp(-(value - current_value) / temp)\n            if np.random.random() < prob:\n=======\n            delta = value - current_value\n            prob = np.exp(-delta / (temp + 1e-8))  # Add small epsilon to avoid division by zero\n            if delta < 0 or np.random.random() < prob:\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n4. Finally, let's optimize the multi-start strategy:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Multi-start simulated annealing with adaptive parameters\n    best_results = []\n    iterations_per_start = iterations // num_starts\n    \n    for start in range(num_starts):\n=======\n    # Enhanced multi-start strategy with varying initial temperatures\n    best_results = []\n    iterations_per_start = max(100, iterations // num_starts)  # Ensure minimum iterations per start\n    \n    for start in range(num_starts):\n        # Vary initial temperature slightly between starts\n        start_temp = initial_temp * (0.8 + 0.4 * np.random.random())\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes will:\n1. Improve exploration with higher initial temperature and slower cooling\n2. Make step sizes more adaptive to both temperature and progress\n3. Make acceptance probability more numerically stable\n4. Add diversity to the multi-start strategy with varying temperatures\n\nThe changes maintain the algorithm's reliability while improving its ability to escape local minima and find the global minimum more consistently, which should improve the value_score and distance_score metrics.\n\nThe cooling rate is made slower (0.995 vs 0.99) to maintain exploration longer, while the initial temperature is increased to allow wider jumps early in the search. The step size calculation now combines both temperature and progress factors in a weighted sum for better balance between exploration and exploitation."],"system":"You are an expert programmer specializing in optimization algorithms.

The key issues are the regression in value_score and distance_score, indicating we're not finding the true minimum as effectively.\n\n1. First, let's improve the initial temperature and cooling rate parameters to better balance exploration and exploitation:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Optimized simulated annealing parameters\n    initial_temp = 50.0  # Even higher initial temperature for wider exploration\n    cooling_rate = 0.995  # Slower cooling to maintain exploration longer\n=======\n    # Optimized simulated annealing parameters based on function characteristics\n    initial_temp = 100.0  # Higher temperature for better initial exploration\n    cooling_rate = 0.99  # Slightly faster cooling to focus on promising areas\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n2. The step size calculation can be improved by incorporating the function's known characteristics (periodic components with quadratic terms):\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n        # Combined adaptive step size using both temperature and progress\n        temp_factor = np.sqrt(temp/initial_temp)  # Square root for smoother decay\n        progress_factor = np.sqrt(1 - i/iterations)  # Square root for smoother decay\n        step_size = (bounds[1] - bounds[0]) * min(temp_factor, progress_factor) * 0.5\n=======\n        # Adaptive step size with temperature-dependent scaling\n        temp_factor = (temp/initial_temp)**0.7  # More aggressive initial steps\n        progress_factor = (1 - i/iterations)**0.5\n        # Scale step size based on current temperature and progress\n        step_size = (bounds[1] - bounds[0]) * temp_factor * (0.5 + 0.5*progress_factor)\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\n3. The multi-start implementation can be enhanced by adding a preliminary coarse search phase:\n\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n    # Enhanced multi-start with dynamic iteration allocation\n    best_results = []\n    # Allocate more iterations to better performing starts\n    base_iterations = iterations // (num_starts * 2)\n    remaining_iterations = iterations - (base_iterations * num_starts)\n=======\n    # Two-phase multi-start with coarse initial search\n    best_results = []\n    \n    # Phase 1: Coarse search with fewer iterations per start\n    coarse_starts = num_starts * 2\n    coarse_iter = iterations // 4\n    for _ in range(coarse_starts):\n        x = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        y = np.random.uniform(bounds[0], bounds[1])\n        best_results.append((x, y, evaluate_function(x, y)))\n    \n    # Phase 2: Refine best candidates\n    num_starts = min(num_starts, len(best_results))\n    best_results.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])\n    base_iterations = (iterations - coarse_iter) // num_starts\n    remaining_iterations = (iterations - coarse_iter) % num_starts\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nThese changes will:\n1. Improve exploration with higher initial temperature while focusing faster on promising areas\n2. Make step sizes more adaptive to the function's characteristics\n3. Add a coarse search phase to better identify promising regions before refinement\n4. Better allocate iterations between exploration and exploitation phases\n\nThe modifications should help escape local minima more effectively while still maintaining the algorithm's reliability and speed characteristics. The two-phase approach is particularly effective for functions with both periodic and quadratic components like ours.\n\nWould you like me to suggest any additional improvements to specific parts of the algorithm?"],"system":"You are an expert programmer specializing in optimization algorithms.

Make restarts more frequent and sensitive to plateaus\n4. Add temperature boosts to help escape local minima\n5. Maintain the reliability while improving global search capability\n\nThe modifications are based on the top-performing programs in the history which showed better value and distance scores, while keeping the core simulated annealing approach intact. The changes focus on improving the algorithm's ability to escape local minima while still converging to the global minimum.\n\nThe exponential step size decay and temperature boosts are particularly effective for functions with many local minima like this one, as they allow for both broad exploration early on and focused search later, while still maintaining the ability to jump out of local optima."],"system":"You are an expert programmer specializing in optimization algorithms.
